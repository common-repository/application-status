== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= The plugin doesn\'t work, why? =

First, check your version of WordPress: the plugin is not supposed to work on old versions anymore. Make sure also to upgrade to the last version of the plugin!

Then try to deactivate and re-activate it, some user have reported that this fixes some problems.

Pay also attention to the \"Permissions\" tab in the Settings: make sure the plugin is enabled for the desired roles and post types.

If it still doesn\'t work, maybe there is some kind of conflict with other plugins: feel free [to write in the forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contact-form-7-status) and we\'ll try to discover a solution (it will be *really* helpful if you try to deactivate all your other plugins one by one to see which one conflicts with mine... But do it only if you know what you\'re doing, I will not be responsible of any problem you may experience).
 
= The plugin is not translated in my language! =

From version 3.0 the plugin\'s translations are managed by the WordPress.org platform and the plugin is shipped without language files, so first of all update translations under Dashboard->Updates.

If Contact-form-7-status is still in English, or if there are some untraslated strings, you can help traslating to your language [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/contact-form-7-status): you only need a WordPress.org account.
